# 🔐 Task 6 – Password Strength Evaluation  

---

## 🧩 Objective
To understand the factors that make a password strong by creating multiple passwords, testing their strength using online tools, and identifying best practices for password security.

---

## 🧠 Methodology
1. Created **five passwords** with varying levels of complexity.  
2. Tested each using:
   o	https://bitwarden.com/password-strength/
   o	https://passwordmeter.com/
   o	https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/
3. Compared the strength ratings and estimated crack times.
4. Summarized key takeaways about password security.

## 🔢 Passwords Tested

| No. | Password | Type |
|----:|-----------|------|
| 1 | `sunshine12` | Weak |
| 2 | `SkyBlue2025` | Moderate |
| 3 | `S!ky_Blue2025` | Strong |
| 4 | `T!ger$Run_47#Fast` | Very Strong |
| 5 | `!9AqX$7rZ&vLp#T2` | Random Strong |

---

## 📊 Findings
- Password **length** greatly improves resistance to brute-force attacks.  
- Including **symbols, uppercase, and lowercase letters** increases entropy.  
- Avoid using **dictionary words** or predictable patterns.  
- **Randomly generated passwords** provide maximum security.  
- **Passphrases** (long but memorable combinations) are ideal for everyday use.

## ⚔️ Common Password Attacks

| Attack Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Brute Force** | Tries every possible character combination. |
| **Dictionary Attack** | Uses a list of common passwords or words. |
| **Phishing** | Tricks users into revealing passwords via fake websites or emails. |
| **Credential Stuffing** | Reuses leaked passwords on multiple sites. |

---

## 💡 Best Practices
1. Use at least **12–16 characters**.  
2. Mix **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**.  
3. Avoid personal info (birthdays, names, etc.).  
4. Use a **unique password** for every account.  
5. Enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**.  
6. Consider a **password manager** (e.g., Bitwarden, 1Password).  
7. Prefer **passphrases** that are long but memorable.

## 🧾 Conclusion
The task demonstrated that password strength primarily depends on **length, randomness, and complexity**.  
Simple or common passwords are instantly cracked, while long and complex ones can resist attacks for thousands of years.  
Adopting secure password practices is essential for safeguarding personal and organizational data.
